### Project Overview
As an investor it should be important to conduct an analysis of the weather to determine if investing in a surf and ice cream shop is a good idea and as a result data from Oahuâ€™s weather was analyzed. The resources utilized were Python, SQLite, VS code, and Jupyter notebook.

### Purpose
We analyzed weather patterns in June and December to determine if the seasons would affect the surf and ice cream shop business. 

### Temperatures in Oahu for June and December (Every Year Data)

![EveryYearData](https://github.com/Samira786/surfs_up/blob/master/June%20and%20December%20-%20every%20year%20data.png)

Above are the temperatures gathered for June and December.<br />
Average: We see that the average for June and December are 74 degrees and 71 degrees respectively.<br />
Standard Deviation: We see the Standard Deviations were 3.25 and 3.74 for June and December respectively, indicating the temperatures could vary around the mean.<br />
Max Temperature: June is 85 degrees while December is 83.<br />
Min Temperature: June is 64 degrees while December is 56.<br />
In conclusion, the temperatures did not vary including in the quartiles for 25%, 50% and 75%. Min temperatures varying is not surprising as December is known for being a colder month. As an aggregate, these temparatures may be favorable for an ice cream business.

### Recommendations
Some recommendations include:<br />
1) Gathering more data to determine the differences between June and December to capture unexpected temperatures or outliers.<br />
2) Compare other months or compare quarters such as January/February/March to October/November/December in order to get a different perspective of the data.<br />
3) Are there other ice cream shops in the area? Are they open all year round? Is there any other data that can be retrieved about the competition?
